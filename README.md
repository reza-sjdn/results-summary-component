Results summary component - This was one of my coolest projects ever. honestly, at first I thought it is a piece of cake.
but I was wrong. It took me hours to complete it and through it I learned lots of things.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In fact I didn't learned any new thing, but reviewed past concepts.
Of course I read an article about mobile-first workflow and learned more
about chrome dev tools.

### Continued development

I'm gonna learn Sass and from now on I wanna incorperate this tool into Css.

### Useful resources

- [A Hands-On Guide to Mobile-First Responsive Design](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/) - I studied mobile-first workflow from this website. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
